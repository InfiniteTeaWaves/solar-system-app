        simulation of our solar system.

    <h3 class="dialog-subheader">What are the assumptions?</h3>
    <p class="dialog-cont-text">This simulation was just made to look pretty and is not scientific. Therefore, almost
        all parameters, such as the rotation speed, orbit speed, orbit eccentricity or the
        distance between planets are not correct. All planets have a circular orbit.

<div class="dialog-section">
    <h3 class="dialog-subheader">What is accurate?</h3>
    <p class="dialog-cont-text">The rotation angles and the corrected size are sort of accurate, although the
        flucuations
        of these parametere are not taken into account.

    <h3 class="dialog-subheader">What is the "Corrected ratio" checkbox?</h3>
    <p class="dialog-cont-text">In this state, the planets are resized relative to each other with their actual relative
        size differences.
